# convex-hull
Construction of convex hull using Chan's algorithm. 
In computational geometry, the problem of a convex hull is to construct a convex hull efficiently and with minimum complexity. Various algorithms are proposed to compute the convex hull, one of which is Chan’s algorithm. The idea of Chan’s algorithm is the combination of two other algorithms- Jarvis March and Graham Scan.

Programming language used in implementation is Python.
